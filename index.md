**Welcome to my Bragdoc!**

I'm **Joel**, a self-taught Brazilian computer programmer. I mostly build web sites and apps, using a variety of tools. Read more about me at [joeljuca.com](https://joeljuca.com).

This is my bragdoc ([?](https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents/)). Here I post my accomplishments in life and career. Feel free to discuss anything you see here on X or Bluesky:
